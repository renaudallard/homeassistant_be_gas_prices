"""The running costs and projections, from the meter's days.

Pure over the inputs the coordinator gathers: the meter's consumption per
local day, the kWh one of its units is worth in each month, the card each
month is billed on, the index values and the household. Kept apart from the
coordinator so every figure the cost sensors publish can be checked without
Home Assistant.
