"""Quoting other contracts against this household.

A quote is a year of the household's gas on a contract's current card: the
annual volume at today's all-in price plus a year of fixed costs, on the
household's own DSO, tier and meter caliber. Every row is priced the same
way, which is what makes the rows comparable: an indexed contract at the
last index value its supplier has published, a fixed one at its price. Both
are what a household signing today would see on the card, not a forecast.

The one-off quote, the ranked comparison and the daily ranking all go
through :func:`quote_contract`.
