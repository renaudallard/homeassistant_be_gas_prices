"""Reading a figure off a line of a tariff card.

Belgian cards print numbers in several ways: a comma decimal, a dot decimal,
a thousands separator beside a decimal comma, a dash for an empty cell. These
turn a line of extracted text, or a row of an HTML table, into numbers, or
refuse rather than guess. They know nothing about which supplier printed it.
