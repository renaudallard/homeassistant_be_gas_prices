"""Belvus gas card extractor.

Belvus publishes one card per product and month at a static path named by
the price month:

    https://www.belvus.be/public/tariefkaarten/<YYYY-MM>/Tariefkaart_<Product>_GAS.pdf

and lists every month since January 2026 on /historische-tariefkaarten,
newest first, which is how the current month's folder is found: the new
folder answers 404 until Belvus uploads it. The same path pattern is the
archive. Both residential gas products are Flanders only and indexed monthly
on TTF_RLP; the Pro twins are professional cards and are not read.

Up to August 2026 the card was a copy of the Energy Together template; from
September it has a layout of its own with the same wording and figures,
including the Fluvius labels printed out of order. :mod:`._energy_together`
reads both. The archive's January to March 2026 cards reprint a 2025
distribution table with a broken row and the April card a mangled one, so
the reader refuses those four months.

Belvus publishes no index values. The realised value of a month is printed
on the next month's card, as the one its "**" price is computed on
("laatst gekende waarde van TTF-DAM 8/2026: €61,729/MWh" on the September
card, "Belpex TTF-DAM" up to April), TTF-DAM naming the TTF_RLP the formula
uses: the "**" price is the formula at that value. So the index table is read
from the archived cards, each giving the month before its own, and only when
the month it names is that month.
