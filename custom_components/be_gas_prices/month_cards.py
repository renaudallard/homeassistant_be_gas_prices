"""The card a past month was billed on.

A month is priced on the card published for it: the supplier's own archive
where it keeps one, then the project's card archive (be_price_cards, written
daily by the archive workflow), then nothing, which leaves the caller to
stand in the current card and say so. A closed month's answer never changes,
so it is kept for good, absent answers included for a day; a failure that
may recover is not kept at all.
