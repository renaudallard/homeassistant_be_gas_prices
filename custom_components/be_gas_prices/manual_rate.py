"""The figures a household typed from its own contract.

A signing card is read from the supplier's or the project's archive, and when
neither reaches the month, or the offer had figures of its own, the household
can type them. They are laid over the energy leg the card gives: a fixed
contract's price, an indexed contract's factor and base, and the yearly fee.
Typed excluding VAT the way formulas are printed, they are put on the card's
VAT-inclusive basis here.
