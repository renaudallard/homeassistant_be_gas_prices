"""The contracts a household held earlier in the year.

When a household changes supplier, the options flow records the settings it
had and the last day they applied, so the year's running cost bills each day
on the contract that supplied it. Each earlier contract is priced on its own
supplier's cards, month by month, the way the current one is.
