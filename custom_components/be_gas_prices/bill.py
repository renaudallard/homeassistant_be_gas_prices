"""A month of gas billed the way a Belgian supplier bills it.

Pure functions over what the coordinator has gathered: which card prices the
month, which energy leg the household is on, the index value the month
settles at, the volume used and the days the month contributes. The running
costs, the projections and the price history are all sums of these.

The rules this encodes:

- The network and the levies of a month come from that month's own card
  where one is known, and the federal levies from the law for that delivery
  month (``_resolve.resolve_federal_levies``).
- The energy leg is the card of the month, or the card the household signed
  (the signing cohort) when the entry says so and the contract is fixed or
  indexed. A variable price is the supplier's for each month, so the card
  of the month sets it whatever the signing date. An indexed leg is priced
  at the index value of the delivery month once the supplier has published
  it, at the latest value it has published before then, and, where it
  publishes none, at the index the card of the month prices its own figure
  at.
- The distribution tier and the excise slices follow the household's annual
  volume, and the yearly fixed costs accrue by the day.
