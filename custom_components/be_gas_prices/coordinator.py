"""The data coordinator of one config entry.

Ticks hourly. Each tick keeps the supplier's card fresh (a cheap probe where
the supplier offers one, a 24-hour TTL otherwise), refreshes the supplier's
index values and the calorific values once a day, reads the gas meter out of
the recorder, and prices the household on all of it.

A card that cannot be fetched is never a reason to stop pricing: the last
good one keeps serving, restored from the entry's store across a restart,
and when there is none or it has gone stale the card archive stands in. The
Repairs cards say when either happens.
